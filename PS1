Problem 1
----------
Prove that Log4(6) is irrational

pf. by contradiction
if Log4(6) is rational than we can express it as n/d where they are elements of positive integers
then by manipulation,
log(6) / log(4) = n / d
6^d = 4^n
(2*3)^d = 2^2n
this prime factorization shows that there is no such value of n and d
thus log4(6) is not rational
QED

Problem 2
----------
Use the Well Ordering Principle to prove that

n <= 3 ^ (n/3), for every nonnegative integer,n

pf. by well Ordering,
assume there is a least k

formula by manipulation,

k ^ 3 <= 3 ^ k

by direct computation we see k>4

k ^ 3

Problem 3
----------
a)
problem: Verify by truth table that (P implies Q) OR (Q implies P) is valid

valid formula is always true regardless of truth value input

P Q  --  (P implies Q) OR (Q implies P)
T T       T    T    T   T  T    T    T
T F       T    F    F   T  F    T    T
F T       F    T    T   T  T    F    F
F F       F    T    F   T  F    T    F

table is true for all values; formula is valid
--
b)
Let P and Q be propositional formulas. Describe a single formula, R, using only AND’s, OR’s, NOT’s, and copies of P and Q, such that R is valid iff P and Q are equivalent

R : (P AND Q) OR NOT(P OR Q)
R is valid iff P and Q are equivalent
--
c)
A  propositional  formula  is satisfiable iff  there  is  an  assignment  of  truth  values  to  its  variables—an environment—which makes it true. Explain why

P is valid    iff NOT(P) is not satisfiable.

if Not(P) is not satifiable that means all inputs to P make P True to in return make Not(P) not satisfiable
there for P will be valid because all inputs to P will make it True
--
d)
A set of propositional formulas P1,...,Pk is consistent iff there is an enviornment in which they are all true. write a formula, S, so that the set P1,...,pk is not consistent iff S is valid.

S = NOT(P1 OR P2 OR P3 ... OR Pk)

Problem 4.

a) P_0 := Not(a_0) , c:= a_0
--
b) o_i = Not(p_i xor b)

--
c) C := c_1 + c_2
--
d) P_i = Not ( r_i-(n+1) Xor C_1)

e)
ripple is going to be some linear time something like 5n +c
parrallel adder is going to be log2(n)
