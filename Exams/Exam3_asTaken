Exam 3

Problem 1.

(a)
antichains of max size
a,b,c
d,b,c

(b)
min parallel time is 4

(c)
with two parallel task it can be complete in 4 tempo
a,b - d,c - e,f - g,h

Problem 2.

(a)
our realtion must be transitive, reflexive, symmetric and antisymmetric
the only relation is the identity relation
A->A

(b)
proof that A = A is the only relation that is both WPO and equivalence
...


Problem 3.

(a)
an example with the nodes u,v,a,b,c
v -- a -- b -- u
     |  /
     c
two paths are v-a-c-b-u, and v-a-b-u
there are no cycles with u or v

(b)
this is very nearly a definition
if there are two different paths between two nodes then the graph is not a minimum spanning tree,
which means we can cut a connection to create a MST. this cut would be to eliminate a edge in a cycle
by definition if a simple graph is not an MST then it has a cycle.

Problem 4.

(a)
proof by induction
in our base case we have a 2 node tree with 2 colors
we can check that there are two different colorings which holds for our
P(n,m) = n(n-1)^(m-1)


assume P(n,m) = n * (n-1)^(m-1)
for some fixed n

in the P(n,m+1) case
we have some tree with m nodes. we add a node to some arbitrary leaf on the tree.
when we do this our equation becomes
n * (n-1)*(n-1)^(m-1)

in each of the existing permutations the leaf will be colored. our m+1 node can be any color that is not the leaf's color it shares a edge with./
therfore we add (n-1) different coloring for our m+1 case
P(n,m) holds
