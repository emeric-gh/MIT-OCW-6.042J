This is the exam that was taken over the first 80 min exam period

Problem 1
Proof by WOP
35^(1/7) =n/d | n/d are in lowest terms, elements of N

my manipulation
(d^7) * 5 * 7 = n^7
by fundamental thym. of arithm. we know that 5 and 7 are factors of n^7
and also 5^7 and 7^7 are factors of n^7 and 5 and 7 are factors of n
which follows that d^7 is proportional to 5^6 * 7^6
so d also has factors of 5 and 7
thus a contradiction of our original def of n and d, being in least terms
the counter example has no least element and is an empty set
QED

---------------------------
Problem 2.
Proof P(a,b,c) is True for a,b,c elements of N, using WOP
C::= {a,b,c element of N| Not(P(a,b,c)) is true}
proof by contradiction C is not empty there is a smallest a,b,c in C

3(x^4 + 3y^4) = z ^4 , where x,y,z are elements of C
well define F(x,y) or simply F = (x^4 + 3y^4)

Z = 3^(1/4) F ^(1/4)
we will note that F will be element of Z
because Z is mapped with addition and exponentiation
so we have some F element of Z+

by cases we have Z taking the form n*3^(3/4) or it not
F(x,y) can not be n*3^(3/4) for reasons mentioned earlier about F element of Z+

furthermore we can show that 3^(1/4) *F is irrational by the method is Problem 1
simply stated this is a root of a prime which by def of prime in not in N.
since F is in Z and 3^(1/4) is not in Z, and in Q
z is irrational
and there is a contradiction of our original definition of z.
C is empty

Problem 3.
∈∀∃
a)
∀x (yx=y)

b)
∀m (n/m =w | w∈ N)

c)
Not(∃m | m|n | m ∈/ {1,n})      , where ∈/ = not element of

d)
lets define a R(x): {p|x  |  (p is prime AND R(x/p)) OR p =1 }
R(n) is valid

Problem 4.
a)  N
b)  B
c)  I
d)  B
e)  S

Problem 5.
S(n=0) = 7 + 7 + 4 ; shows that our base case is valid

also
S(19) = 7 + 4 + 4 + 4
S(20) = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4

S(n) implies S(n+1)
assume S(n)
by cases we will show S(n+1) is valid


case 1.
S(n) has one 7 or more
in that case replace 7 with 4+4
to make S(n+1)

Case 2.
S(n) has no 7
by our base cases S(n) | n >= 20
S(n) will have at least five '4's;
S(n+1) is made by removing five 4 and replacing with 7+7+7

we can see that it holds that with n>20 S(n) will either have one 7 or
>= five '4' (because three sevens becomes six fours etc.)
this completes the cases
