Problem 1.

Problem 2.

(a)
2.
(b,l) -> (b,0)
3.
if b>10-l, (b,l) -> (b-l,10)
if b<10-l, (b,l) -> (0,b+l)

(b)
once they are multiples of 5, b,l will be preserved as multiples of 5
transition 1, preserves this
transition 2, preserves this
transition 3, we have b-l which would be a multiple of 5 minus a multiple of 5
or b+l which would be a multiple of 5 as well
13 is not a multiple of 5, so we will never arrive therefor

Problem 3.


Problem 4.

(a) gcd(m,n,p)
2^3 * 7^4

(b) lcm()
2^9 * 3^4 * 5^24 * 7^6042 * 11^211 * 19 ^30

Problem 5


Problem 6.

(a)
phi(2) = 1

(b)
phi(k) = 2
k=3
k=4
k=6

(c)

we know that every number has a unique prime factorization
obviously every prime over 2 is odd
we have a theorem that states that
phi(p^k) = p^k-p^(k-1), for some prime p
and we have that if a,b are coprime then
phi(ab) = phi(a)phi(b)


case 1: if our number has more than 1 prime factor term
suppose we call a the first term of the prime factorization (p^k) of any number
and b is the rest of the prime factorization
phi(a) will be
p^k-p^(k-1)
which must be and ODD number less an ODD number
phi(a) must be even, and if phi(a) is even then
phi of our whole number is even

case 2: if our number only has 1 prime factorization term then it
must take the form p^k
and phi(p^k) = p^k-p^(k-1)
we have already shown to be even.
thus completes our cases and the proof.
