Problem 3.
we can choose a sequence of A as elements  a_1, a_2, a_3, ... in A
we define a map A to (A U B) as follows
if a in A is not an element of the sequence then send it to itself.
B is countable so we can label its elements 1,2,3,4...
now...  map  a_1, a_2, a_3,... to  (A U B) in the following way
a_1 goes to 1
a_2 goes to a_1
a_3 goes to 2
a_4 goes to a_2
a_5 goes to 3
a_6 goes to a_3
...
a_(2n) goes to a_n.
a_(2n-1) goes to n
this gives us a bijection between A and (A U B)
