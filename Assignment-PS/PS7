Problem Set 7
Started 7/6/2020

Problem 1.
(a)
inv(R)
if aRb and bRc implies aRc
then b inv(R)a and c inv(R)b implies c inv(R)a

(b)
R intersect S
if a R b and b R c implies a R c
and a S b and b S c implies a S c
then of course
a R&S b and b R&S c implies a R&S c

(c)
R compose R
R compose R is transitive
*incomplete**

(d)
R compose S
this is not transitive.
counter example
*incomplete**

Problem 2

(a)
intersect of two equivalence relations
is equivalence relation
*incomplete**

(b)
union of two equivalence relations
is not necessarily an equivalence relation
*incomplete**

Problem 3
G3 is not isomorphic with G1, G2, or G4
G3 has two 4th degree verticies and G1, G2, and G4 have only 3rd degree

G1 and G2 are not the same because
G2 can form a number of cycles that hit every vertex once and return to the start
G1 can not do these cycles
G4 also fails to do these cycles

Proof that degrees are preserved in isomorphism:
if some
{x,y} element of E(G) and {f(x),f(y)} is element of E(G)
then |E(G)| should be preserved, but if
theres more degrees in one graph than |E(G)| hasnt been preserved
QED


comparing G1 and G4
these are an isomorphic pair
the isomorphism f is as follows
f: G1 -> G4
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(5) = 9
f(4) = 8
f(3) = 3
f(7) = 4
f(10) = 7
f(8) = 5
f(9) = 6
f(6) = 10

Problem 4.
(a)
counter example
-<>-, <1-2>, <2-3>,<2-4>,<3-5>,<4-5>, <5-6>

(b)
the first erroneous statement that is made is
"the new edge must join an endpoint of Gn to a new vertex"
with a 5 length Gn you could ad an edge to make a cycle in the middle and still have two ends
the error does not cover the cases, also the figure is misleading
