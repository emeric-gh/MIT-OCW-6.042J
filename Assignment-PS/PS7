Started 7/6/2020

Problem 1.
(a)
inv(R)
if aRb and bRc implies aRc
then b inv(R)a and c inv(R)b implies c inv(R)a

(b)
R intersect S
if a R b and b R c implies a R c
and a S b and b S c implies a S c
then of course
a R&S b and b R&S c implies a R&S c

(c)
R compose R
R compose R is transitive
*incomplete**

(d)
R compose S
this is not transitive.
counter example
*incomplete**

Problem 2

(a)
intersect of two equivalence relations
is equivalence relation
*incomplete**

(b)
union of two equivalence relations
is not nessisarily an equivalence relation
*incomplete**

Problem 3

it looks like
G1 G2 and G3 are isomorphic
