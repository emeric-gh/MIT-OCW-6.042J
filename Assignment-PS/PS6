Problem Set 6
Started 7/5/2020

Problem 1.

p,q element of 200 digit primes, p != q
n=pq
m element of [0..n)

gcd(m,n) = q
gcd(m,pq) = q
m = k(q)

there are q-1 such multiples of q.; similar to theorem 8.10.10
so our fraction is
q-1/n
q ~ 10^200
n ~ 10^400

so our fraction of dangerous messages is roughly 1/10^200


Problem 2.
(a)
u <-> x <-> v
there is a path from u to v, and from v to u but no cycle containing both u and v

(b)
prove that if there is a positive length walk in digraph that starts and ends at node v,
then there is a cycle that contains v

from theorem 9.2.3 the shortest walk is a path
from lemma 9.2.6 the shortest closed path through v is a cycle through v

so there must be a cycle though v

Problem 3.

(a)
the simplest case for a 10-chicken tournament graph with a king chicken that has outdegree 1
would be:
the special case king (K) connects its one out to a proxy (P).
the proxy pecks every remaining chickens 3-10.
after these connections all other connections can be filled arbitrarily to fit the definition of a tournament digraph

K -> P -> {3..10}
-note that K will not be the only king

(b)
a 5-chicken tournament graph with all kings (k_i)
on the ring Z_5
all k_i peck k_i+1
all k_i peck k_i-2
after this all other relations can be filled arbitrarily

we can see that i will peck i+1, i-2, and virtually peck i-1, and i+2,
which accounts for all other chickens

(c)
so we have some k with the most outdegrees (pecks), who pecks some set of direct pecks well call d el.of D
then we have the indirect pecks i el. of I, who peck the k
we know that the size of D is larger than I because sum Outdegree is the sum of edges and k has above average outdegree by definition

suppose k is not a King,
then there would be some i who pecks k and all in the set D.
this raises a contradiction. the i who pecks k and the entire set of D
would have more outdegrees than k, which can not be true.

there must be some path from k to every i through some d
k reaches all others (i and d) through direct or virtual, and is therefore a King
