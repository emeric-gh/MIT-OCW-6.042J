Problem Set 2
## Started 5/14/2020
Problem 1
a) explain how to write a formula Members(p,a,b) that means p = {a,b}
p = a OR b
this is a short hand for for all z is and elment of (p and a) or (p and b)
b) eplain how to write a the formula Pair(p,a,b of set theory that means p= pair(a,b)
pair(a,b) is equivalent to {a,{a,b}} so if we use our member notiation we get
Members(p,a,Members(p,a,b))

Members(p," ",Members(p," ",b))


Problem 2
Not(A⋂B) = Not A ⋃ Not B

Not (P and Q) is equivalent to Not(P) OR Not(Q)

iff x ∈ Not(P) or Not(Q)
iff x ∈ Not (P And Q)
so Not P And Q is equivalent to Not P or nott Q

Problem 3
a)show that if R and S are c-d then so is R⋂S
b)
our zero count sets are
{0},{1},Ø
Our 1 count sets
 Øc , that is complement of empty set
 our 2 count sets
 are 0B1

 c)
 starting with {Ø}, {1}
 complement of empty set gives B
 B cat {1} is all language with atleast one 1
 Cat of that gives 0* so 0* is c-d


 d)
 Start with {Ø}, {1}, {0}, {00}, {11}
 {Ø}c = B
 ({00}B{11} ⋃ {0} ⋃ {1} )c
 gives out answer of
 {01}*


 e)
 {00}* is not boring because
 there are an infinte set of even 0s words and infinte set of odd 0 in the
 complement

 f)
 verify by cases
case 1.
 suppose Rn0* is finite and Sn0* is infinite
 then we know,
 Rc n0* is infinite and Sc n0* is finite

 We would like to show that (RuS)n0* is finite or (RuS)c n0* is finite
 concider (RuS)c
by demorgan's law we have (Rc n Sc) this is contained in Sc
and Sc n0* is finite

case 2.
in the opposite case we have Rn0* is inf. and Sn0* is finite


g)
verify by cases
case 1.
Rn0* is finite, Sn0* is finite
(R dot S) n 0* is finite, because youre just going to have product of infinite

Rn0* is finite, Sn0* is infinite
