Problem Set 4
Started 6/6/2020

Problem 1.
There are two methods that i like to prove this
 the first by linear algebra
 the moves collapse into a number of moves i in (2,-1) direction i ∈ Z
 and a number of moves j in (1, 3), j ∈ Z

 so you we would like to  get i * (2,-1) + j (1,3) = (1,1)
 so j = 1 -2i by the top

 i= −1+3j = −1+3(1−2i) =2−6i, constrained by the bottom,
 gives us i = 2/7 thus a contradiction. we can not reach 1,1
--------------------------------------
 Solution
 with invariants we can observe that
 (3x - y) mod7 = 0
 r(a+x,b+y)
 =(3(a+x)−(b+y))mod7
 =((3a−b)+(3x−y))mod7
 =(3a−b)mod7
 =r(a,b)
 so for r(1,1) = 2 , we can see that the bot can not equal (1,1)

Problem 2.

proof by structural induction
P(n) : f_b = n_b + 1 ; where b is a binary tree and f_b are distinct leaf labels and
n_b are distinct internal labels

in the base case we have the zero depth binary tree, it has 1 leaf and no internal
so this satisfies our equation

lets say that we label our nodes to be unique by numbering them top to bottom left to right
     1
   /   \
  2     3
 / \   / \
4   5 6   7
(...)
/    \
(k-1) k

assume that P(k): f = n + 1 is true for some P(n) where n is odd due to n starting at 1 and
each binary tree introducing 2 nodes at a time

our induction step will there for be n+2, however we could redefine this to be a system where n is indexed by 1 and count the pairs of nodes + 1
regardless
for the induction step
P(n+2): 1 leaf is turned into an internal node, and two new leaves are created so
f' = f -1 + 2 and
on internal node is created out of a prior leaf
n' = n + 1

P(n+1): f' = n' + 1
f + 1 = n+ 1 + 1
P(n+1): f = n + 1
thus completing the proof


Problem 3.

(a)
our bijection could be

f(x): 1/x - 1
where x: (0:1] and y= f(x) : [0,inf)


(b)
our bijection from L to (0,1]
is going to be putting a decimal point at the beginning of our sequence element of L
some interesting cases are,
the infinite sequence of all 9s bijects to 0.(9)repeating =1
this is also the case for all terminating values in (0,1]
e.g. 0.2 will be 0.1(9)repeating
it is an important feature that there cant be inf. 0s because this would be the same as
inf 9 cases

(c)
our surjection from L to L2
we will take alternating characters from each sequence element of L and map
the odd index and even index to L2, only if the odd indexed sequence and even sequence
are element of L

(d)
given our sets A and B if we describe a bijection where a ∈ A, and b ∈ B for each a there is a b
then we describe the set A x A as the pairing (a,a) where each a is not necissarly the same element; and like wise for B x B, then the mapping from A -> B
can be used on each element in the pair to map each (a,a) to (b,b) thus A x A bij B x B
QED

(e)
from part (b) we know there is a bij from (0,1] to L
(0,1] bij L
then from (c) we know there is
(0,1] bij L surj L2
then from (d) we can append
(0,1] bij L surj L2 bij (0,1]^2
therefor surj from (0,1] to (0,1]2
(0,1] surj (0,1]2

schroder-berstein (SB) says A surj B,  and B surj A then A bij B

so lets call (0,1], D and d element of D
D2 could be described by the ordered pair(d1,d2) where d1 element of D and d2 is a possibly different element of D
we can show that we can map a surj from D2 to D by
maping each (d1, lambda) to d in D, and mapping (d1,d2) | d1 = d2, to d in D
this is an obvious surj.
the we invoke SB because D surj D2 and D2 surj D
D bij D2


(f)
from (e)
 (0,1] bij (0,1]2
 (0,1] bij [0,inf)
 from lemma in (d)
  (0,1]2 bij [0,inf)2
  and
  (0,1] bij (0,1]2 bij [0,inf)2
  or
  (0,1] bij [0,inf)2
