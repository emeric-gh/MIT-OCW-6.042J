Problem Set 3


Problem 1.
prove using strong induction, the following closed-form fomula for Fn
Fn =( P^n - Q^n ) / rad(5)

where p =( 1+ rad(5) ) / 2, and q = ( 1 - rad(5)) / 2

by direct computation n holds for 1,2 and 3
so we will show that n>=3 hold as well
rad(5) f(n) = p ^(n-2) + p^(n-1) - (q ^(n-2)+ q ^(n-1))
rhs = p^(n-2) (1 + p) - q^(n-2) (1 + q)
now using p^2 = p+1 and same for q

p^(n-2)(p^2) - q^(n-2)(q^2)
F(n) =( p^n -q^n ) / rad(5), for n>=3 thus completes the Proof



Problem 2.
Any sequence of moves that can take a game state from A to state B

suppose we have a function S(n) that gives the score of a number of moves n.
if we start with a set A_0 and take one move to A_1 where A_1 is also equal to B
our change in score of
P(A) is P(unchanged stacks) + P(changed stack)
our changed stack will be a stack of a + b height that will be split into a and b size
so our
P(A_0) = P(unchanged stacks) + P(a+b)
P(A_1) = P(unchanged stacks) + P(a)+ P(b)
which makes our
S(1) = P(A_0) - P(A_1) = P(a+b) - (P(a)+ P(b))
our P(unchanged stacks) will cancel so we will disregard them from now on
if we substitute the potential formula P(S) = k(k-1)/2
we get
P(A_0) = (a+b)(a+b-1)/2  = (a^2 -a + b^2 -b + 2ab ) 1/2
P(A_1)  = (a^2 - a + b^2 -b)1/2

so S(1) = ab
this is our base case
for our induction step
we have that S(n) = S(0) + S(1) + ... + S(n-1)
which is = P(A_0) - P(A_1) + P(A_1) - P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n-2) - P(A_n-1)
assume this to be True
for S(n+1) we see that if the first state A_0 is simply called A and A_n term is called B
then we get S(n+1) = P(A_0) - P(A_1) + P(A_1) - P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n-2) - P(A_n-1) + P(A_n-1) - P(A_n)
everything except the beginnning and end cancel in a telescoping series
therefore
 S(n+1) = P(A_0) - P(A_n) = P(A) - P(B)
 thus completing the Proof that the score is P(A) - P(B)
each individual move has been shown to be equivalent to ab, this will always be positive
and the sum of positive score changes will be positive, unless there is no move change from P(A) to P(B)
in which case P(A)=P(B) and the score is 0.
therefore P(A)>=P(B)
thus completing the other proof.







Problem 3.

(a) If h is surjective, then f must be surjective.
suppose f o g is surjective, let z ∈ C, and x ∈ A such that f(g(x))=z
therefore if we let y = g(x) ∈ B, then f(y) =z , thus f is surjective, IE for our arbitrary z we found that
there is a y that maps, so f is surjective. Proof, that A is True

(b)If h is surjective, then g must be surjective
this is false by counter example,
if we let A = {1}, B = {1,2} and C = {1}
g is g(1) = 1, f is f(1) = f(2) = 1, and h(1) = 1
we can see that g is injective, and h is injective and surjective
therefore (b) claim is false

(c) If h is injective, then f must be injective
our counter example for this is the same as for (b) basically when h is injective and
surjective we can have f be surjective using the same example.
therefore (c) is false

(d)
g is either injective or not injective
if g is not injective then there is a an element in b with >1 arrow in
this element of b will have 1 arrow out because it is a total function
this will mean that  h will map from 2 elements in A to 1 elements in C
which means it will fail to be injective, thus a contradiction
