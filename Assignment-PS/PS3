Problem Set 3


Problem 1.
prove using strong induction, the following closed-form fomula for Fn
Fn =( P^n - Q^n ) / rad(5)

where p =( 1+ rad(5) ) / 2, and q = ( 1 - rad(5)) / 2

by direct computation n holds for 1,2 and 3
so we will show that n>=3 hold as well
rad(5) f(n) = p ^(n-2) + p^(n-1) - (q ^(n-2)+ q ^(n-1))
rhs = p^(n-2) (1 + p) - q^(n-2) (1 + q)
now using p^2 = p+1 and same for q

p^(n-2)(p^2) - q^(n-2)(q^2)
F(n) =( p^n -q^n ) / rad(5), for n>=3 thus completes the Proof



Problem 2.
Any sequence of moves that can take a game state from A to state B
can be done so is a series of moves that we will represent as
taking a stack of size a+b and creating an a size and a b size
the A of our one move example will be P(A) = P(sigma_i) + P(a+b) where sigma is all unchanged stacks
P(B) = P(sigma_i) + P(a) + P(b)
if we use the score potential P(S) = k(k-1)/2 then
P(A) is (a+b)(a+b-1)/2 + P(sigma_i), which we can rearange to
(a^2 -a + b^2 -b + 2ab ) 1/2 + P(sigma_i)
similarly P(B) is
(a^2 - a + b^2 -b)/2 + P(sigma_i)
we can see that P(A)> P(B)
P(A)-P(B) = ab
all steps from 1 game state to another game state will but the sum of move like this
that is the sum of positive number will be positive
therefore
P(A) >= P(B) where A can be turned into B by a number of moves

suppose S(n) is our score function for number of moves n
S(0) = P(A) - P(B)
were P(B) = P(A)
S(0) is 0 which is valid

S(n) = P(unchanged) + P(changed blocks in n moves)
assume that,
unchanged is 0 , so S(n) = P(A)- P(B) = P(changed blocks in n moves)

S(n+1) = P(unchanged) + P(changed blocks in n moves) + P(a+b) - P(a) + P(b)
weve shown that P(a+b) - P(a) + P(b) is ab
so S(n+1) = 0 + P(A)n - P(B)n + our score for 1 move






Problem 3.

(a) If h is surjective, then f must be surjective.
suppose f o g is surjective, let z ∈ C, and x ∈ A such that f(g(x))=z
therefore if we let y = g(x) ∈ B, then f(y) =z , thus f is surjective, IE for our arbitrary z we found that
there is a y that maps, so f is surjective. Proof, that A is True

(b)If h is surjective, then g must be surjective
this is false by counter example,
if we let A = {1}, B = {1,2} and C = {1}
g is g(1) = 1, f is f(1) = f(2) = 1, and h(1) = 1
we can see that g is injective, and h is injective and surjective
therefore (b) claim is false

(c) If h is injective, then f must be injective
our counter example for this is the same as for (b) basically when h is injective and
surjective we can have f be surjective using the same example.
therefore (c) is false

(d)
g is either injective or not injective
if g is not injective then there is a an element in b with >1 arrow in
this element of b will have 1 arrow out because it is a total function
this will mean that  h will map from 2 elements in A to 1 elements in C
which means it will fail to be injective, thus a contradiction
