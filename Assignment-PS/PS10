Problem 1
(a)
Our set of rolls will be A = B * C
where
B is permutations of {1,...,5}
C is a set of colors of two dice with the value 6

|A| = 7 choose 2 * 5!

(b)
similar to above except
now A = B * C * D
where D is the different values of the matching dice
all other sets are the same

|A| = (7 choose 2) * 5! * 6

(c)
in this case we have
E = F * G * H * I
were the first three elements
choose two elemments
and there are 4 ways to choose the three dice since there value must differ from the 2

(7 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) * (5 choose 2) * 4
