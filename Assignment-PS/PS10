Problem Set/ Assignment 10

Problem 1
(a)
Our set of rolls will be A = B * C
where
B is permutations of {1,...,5}
C is a set of colors of two dice with the value 6

|A| = 7 choose 2 * 5!

(b)
similar to above except
now A = B * C * D
where D is the different values of the matching dice
all other sets are the same

|A| = (7 choose 2) * 5! * 6

(c)
in this case we have
E = F * G * H * I
were the first three elements
choose two elemments
and there are 4 ways to choose the three dice since there value must differ from the 2

(7 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) * (5 choose 2) * 4

Problem 2
(a)
first we can make permutations of all 21 consonents.
then we have 21 positions to the left of each consonants.
and 5 vowels to place.
so
21!*(21 P 5)

(b)
we can arrange our vowels and consonants into strings,
then we need to combine them to take the form
vcc...vcc...vcc..vcc..vcc
we then have to partition our remainging consonants into the gaps
so we have
5! * 21! * (p(11) - p(4))

(c)
we could arrange our student in a line and match
student k with student k+1
we then have to concider when two lines have the same pairings
such as ABCD... CDBA...
we need to remove the 2^n ways in which pairs can be swapped
and the n! ways in which pairs can be reordered
so there are
(2n!) / (2^n*n!)


(d)
we would like to represent our digits as
k element of {0,1,...,9},
and x_k is the number of copies of the kth digit of our n-digit type
so we have
x_0 + x_1 +...+ x_9 = n

we can solve this using the stars and bars theorem
with binomial coef.
(n+9)  = (n+9)
( 9 )  = ( n )

Problem 3.

(a)
we would like to show that
(x1 + x2 + ... + xn)^p is congruent to x1^p + x2^p +...+ xn^p  (mod p)

the LHS, using Theorem 14.6.5 is
SigmaNotation( multinomial coefficient( p; k1,k2...,kn))*x1^k1*x2^k2*...*xn^kn

if we look at the multinomial coefficients we can see that this term will be divisible by p
if all of the ki terms are less than p
it will take the form of
p!/(k1*...*kn)
the factorial of p provides of factor of p that is not removed in this case

so all these terms on the loop (mod p) will be zero

the multinomial coefficients where some ki = p we will have the coeficient of 1
which is every thing that is left over on the RHS
x1^p = x1^k1, x2^p = x2^k2, ... ,xn^p = xn^kn
thus the two sides are congruent on mod p, QED

(b)
this means that
say we have the multinomial
(1+1+1...+1)^p = n^p
we know from (a)
that
our LHS will be 1^p +1^p ...+1^p + [the part thats all divisible by p]
1^p +1^p ...+1^p = n
so n^p = n + [some number divisible by p]
n^p - n = n(n^(p-1) -1) are divisible by p
n^(p-1) - 1 is divisible by p if n is not divisible by p
QED
