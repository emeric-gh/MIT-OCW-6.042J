Assignment 11

Problem 1.

(a)
each row could be colored in
3^4 different ways, which is 81
since their are 81 holes and 82 pigeons
the pigeonhole principle tells us that two rows must have the same pattern

(b)

from (a) we know two rows have the same color pattern
we also know that each row has 4 col. and there are only 3 colors
so each row must repeat at least 1 color, including our two identical rows
therefor we can make a rectangle with same color corners by using our rows from (a)
and the repeat color in the two rows

(c)

the two locations of the repeat color in each row has
4 choose 2 possibilities and 3 different colors
this totals 18 , so with 19 rows we know there would be
two rows with repeat colors in the same positions
which would make a rectangle

Problem 2.

proof by induction that in a game of n shuffled cards with b qty black cards
and r qty red cards skipping a card strategy is the same as taking the first card strategy

in our base case we have n =2 cards
taking the first card is the same as skipping the card as we are forced to take the next card
so in our shuffled deck we either get 1 card or the other. we have a 50% chance of getting either card with both strategies
in a shuffled deck

in our induction step:
we have an n sized deck that has some number b such that n - b = r;
n is >2 and b and r are positive ints

we have two cases for winning
we have a
b/n chance of skipping a black card

and a 1-b/n chance of skipping a red card

which means for the next round the likely hood of winning will be

(b/n)((b-1)/(n-1))  +  1-b/n  *  b/(n-1)

which reduces to
b/(n-1) - b^2 / (n^2 - n)  +  b^2 - b / (n^2 - n)
and middle term cancels
b/(n-1) + -b/(n^2 - n)
which with common factors reduces to
b/n,
proving that the odds don't change with the skipping strategy
QED

Problem 3.

(a)
1.
our probablity space is
AhJ
AsJ
AhAs
p=1 our hand has an A in it

2.
each even it 1/3
so 2/3 Ah is in your hand

3.
revealed card just collapses the hand phase of this game
its the same as 3 choose 1
1/3 revealed card is Ah

4.
2/3
revealed card in an A

(b)

1.
this is tautologically the same

2.
this becomes p =1

3.
p = 1/2

4.
p = 1

(c)

if there are d distinct cards then
1/d cards in the Ah
this is our probablity space
if we draw h cards per hand then
pr[we have Ah in hand] = h* 1/d

(d)
