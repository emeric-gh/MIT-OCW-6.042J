Problem 1.

(a)
our first ritual with the student as the males, yields the following marriages

Sarah     - At&t
Albert    - Bellcore
Tasha     - HP
Elizabeth - Draper

and with the companies as the males

At&t     - Albert
Bellcore - Sarah
HP       - Tasha
Draper   - Elizabeth

(b)
one procedure would be run the matching twice with one side as male and then the other side as male
then compare them
this is because if optimal matching is the same as pessimal matching then there is 1 ordering
