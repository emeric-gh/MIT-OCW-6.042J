Problem 1.

(a)
our first ritual with the student as the males, yields the following marriages

Sarah     - At&t
Albert    - Bellcore
Tasha     - HP
Elizabeth - Draper

and with the companies as the males

At&t     - Albert
Bellcore - Sarah
HP       - Tasha
Draper   - Elizabeth

(b)
one procedure would be run the matching twice with one side as male and then the other side as male
then compare them
this is because if optimal matching is the same as pessimal matching then there is 1 ordering

Problem 2.

(a)
this is preserved once its true it cant become untrue.
this is because the ritual garentees everyone get married at the end so alice
will never be removed from the list.

(b)
this is true until the day that ends in termination
so ultimately it is not preserved.

(c)
alice is going up in preference and harry is going down in preference.
if this were false then this would create a rogue couple

(d)
this is preserved, because the men serenade in order of preference.
so if she was crossed off then she was higher pref. to anyone hes serenading afterwards

(e)
this is not preserved in all cases.
there could be a suiter that gets rejected then moves to alice that she perfers over harry

Problem 3.

let some boy "b" and some girl "g" be people that will not be married at the end of the ritual.
we would like to show that they are not a rogue couple, and therefor the ritual works

consider two cases
case 1.
g is not on b's list. then by the invariant we know g perfers her husband to b.
so they are not a rogue couple.
case 2.
g is on b's list. but since b does not marry g, then there must be higher priorities on his list
one of which he will marry. and he will perfer to g so he must prefer his wife.
so b and g cant be a rogue couple
since b is an arbitrary boy it holds for all boys
