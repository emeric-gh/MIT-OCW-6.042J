Problem 1.

The team one strategy will be to choose randomly a number from 0-6
and then the second number will be 1 more than the first.

in this way if any number besides 0 is revealed first then the unrevealed number
is either one greater or one less.
only when they select the card with zero will they know which is greater.
zero has to be included however because when 1 is revealed from a first flip,
team 1 needs there to be a possibility that there is a lower or higher number.
so for 6/7 of the number from 0-6 there is a 1/2 chance that team 2 picks the correct outcome.

meaning that team 1 can maintain their
(6/7) * (1/2) win rate.

Problem 2.

two variables are independent if
Pr(A n B) = Pr(A)Pr(B)

from our hint
A1 = A and A0 = Abar,
so I_A = c is the same as Ac for c element of {0,1}
likewise for B
from this
if A and B are independent
then
we know that
Abar and Bbar , as well as A and Bbar, B and Abar
and from our definition we can see that the indicators
are independent if A and B are independent
from our definition we also
know that either A1 = B1 or A0 = B1,
there for A and B must be independent.
