Problem 1.
(a)
there are 10^9 total numbers
9^9 numbers without a 1 in any position.
IE 0,2-9 in each of 9 positions
10^9 - 9^9 numbers with no 1s

(b)
we could make a bijection in the following way. choose books left to right
unchoosen books are labeled 0. the label 1 represents the book that is choosen on the left
and the adjecent unselectable book on the right. the final selected book is by it self represented with a 1.
this will biject to 15 strings with exactly 6 ones

Problem 2.

(a)
the code give us every node except two.
the numbers that do not appear, we know the larger of the two is a leaf attached to the other.
the tree is then constructed by taking the first number off the code
ignoring the largest leaf and recursively proceeding through the code.

(b)
there are as many n-vertex numbered trees as the number of possible codes, n-2.
IE n^(n-2)

the code for trees is a bijection we can see this by observing that each code only creates 1 tree and
each tree derives one code.

Problem 3.
**incomplete**
