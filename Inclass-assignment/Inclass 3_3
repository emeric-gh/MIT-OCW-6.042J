Problem 1.
(a)
there are 10^9 total numbers
9^9 numbers without a 1 in any position.
IE 0,2-9 in each of 9 positions
10^9 - 9^9 numbers with no 1s

(b)
we could make a bijection in the following way. choose books left to right
unchoosen books are labeled 0. the label 1 represents the book that is choosen on the left
and the adjecent unselectable book on the right. the final selected book is by it self represented with a 1.
this will biject to 15 strings with exactly 6 ones

Problem 2.

(a)
the code give us every node except two.
however by the rules we know that the larger of the two unnammed numbers i connected to the first leaf we attache.
then we reconstruct the tree taking each number off of the code
