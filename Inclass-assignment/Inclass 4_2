Problem 1.
a)

Pr[B] = 1/1000

Pr[Y|B] = 1/100

Pr[Ybar|Bbar] =

b)
incomplete

c)
incomplete

d)
incomplete

e)
incomplete

problem 2.

well call each villian:
S for sauron, F for foo-foo, and V for Voldermort
Release selections are, -> then the declaration
VS -> V  this is probability 2/6
VB -> V " " 1/6
  or ->B   1/6
SB -> B  2/6

the mistake he was likely that when V and B are released the odds of declaring B
are no the same as when S and B are being released. there are half probability that V or B will be anounced
so there is still 2/6 that S will be released.

Problem 3.
the space is

. ->52 card deck -> 51 other cards
                  -> 8h
. ->51 card deck ->50 other cards
                  -> 8h

our probability space is
1/2 for each deck then
1/51 for the smaller deck and
1/52 for the larger deck

Pr[52deck|8h] =

Pr[52 intersect 8h] / Pr[8h] = (1/52*1/2 ) / (1/2 * 1/52 + 1/2 1/51)

our answer is 51/103
