Inclass Problems 9
Problem 1
(a)
P((r,s,a)) == [rs + a = xy]

so we want to show that P is a preserved invariant of R

for even we would like to show that P((r_t,s_t,a_t)) holds
hold for
r_t*s_t + a_t = 2r*s/2 + a
= rs + a
= xy
holds for even

for odds
2r(s-1)/2 + (a+r)
sr-r + a + r
sr + a = xy
holds for odds

(b)
based on what we showed for (a) rs+a = xy,
the machine will stop for even or odd when s=0
so a= xy

(c) number of transition is a count down of S, s is at least halved every transition
this will take log steps
binary representation of a number is also known to be long length of the number
so the transition count will be the same number as the length of the binary representation

Problem 2
(a)
 list representation of start 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 (4,4)
 list representation of impossible 15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 (4,4)

(b)
 our start state has zero out of order, and is row 4 so its parity is 0
 our impossible state has n(n+1)/2 out of order where n is 14, so its out of order pairs is 105 plus row 4
 so its parity is 1
 thus parity is different
 (c)
 in the case that the gap moves a column,
 we will get a preserved order
 .... n_i, gap, n_i+1, n_i+2 , anywhere we transition the gap to is like ignoring the gap
when it comes to the order because we are just swapping thing with the gap no with eachother

in the case that the gap moves by row, the effect is the number either moves up the list by 3 or down the list by 3. each number that the moved tile
jumps ahead of or behind can either remove a pair or add a pair to our out-of-order list.
so the number of out of order pairs change will always be odd, our row change i will also be odd, because its a row change of 1, our sum of odd changes is even.
so our change in P(L) + i is even, so if it started odd it stays odd if it started even it stays even.
therefor parity never changes

Problem 3
 Transition 1 when
 let car on {A+3, B, C+1}; A-B <T_0 and C<=1000
 Transition 2
 let car off {A, B+2,C-1}; 0<C<= 1000

 b)
A               WI
B               WI
A+B             SI
A-B              N
3C - A          WD
2A-3B           N
B + 3C          N
2A - 3B -6C     C
2A - 2B -3C     N

c)
let D_0 = 2A_0 - 3B_0 - 6C_0
Preserved invariant P(A,B,C) ::== [2A-3B-6C = D_0] and [C<=1000]

We can show that this is true by
c'=C+1, A'=A+3, B'=b
inserted into our P()(A',B',C')) we still get
[2A'-3B'-6C' = D_0]
also A-B <T_0
A - B < T_0
A <= T_0 + B-1
inserted into our invariant we have
note A' = A + 3, B' = B =B_0
2(T_0 + B - 1 + 3) - 3B - 6C' = D_0
2(3(1000-C_0) +(A_0-B_0)) + B + 2) - 3B' - 6C' = D_0
6000-6C_0 + 2A_0- 2B_0 +2B_0 +4 - 3B_0 - 6C' = D_0
remove the invariant 2A_0-3B_0-6C_0 = D_0
6C'= 6004/6 = C'= 1000 as required also C' < C <= 1000

d)
with each car over the bridge A-B increase by 1
after 3000 cars go over the bridge cars can not enter the bridge
A-B >= 3000 + A_0 - B_0
>= 3(1000-C_0) +(A_0-B_0) = T_0
after that only cars can exit after at most 4000 transitions
