Problem 1.
(a)
x30 + y22 = gcd(30, 22)
8 = 30 - 1(22)       =  a-1b
6 = 22 - 2(8)        = b-2(8)
                    =b-2(a-b)
                    =3b-2a
2 = 8 -1(6)         =a-b -1(3b-2a)
                    =3a-4b < ---------
0 = 6 -3(2)
2; 3(30) + -4(22)


(b)
x'=3-22 = -19
y'=-4+30 = 26


Problem 2.
(a)
gcd(m,n) = 2^3 * 11^7 * 17^9
lcm(m,n) = 2^9 5^24 7^22 11^211 13^1 17^12 19^2
mn = 2^12 5^24 7^22 11^218 13^1 17^21 19^2

gcd()*lcm() = mn

(b)
in general for gcd
if m has a prime factor p^x
and n has a prime factor p'^x'
the gcd will be the lesser of the two factors for each prime factor
the result is the product of the series

in general for the lcd will be the larger of two factors for each prime factor
the result is the product of the series
so the GCD or the LCD are both capturing all elements of m and n (even if p^x is 1)
then those are made into a product series
then GCD and LCD must be a rearrangement of mn. and ab = ba for all a and b

Problem 3

(a)
our invariant P : gcd(ex,ey) = gcd(a,b)
when we get to the the last step we have
gcd(e*1,e*0) = e ; which is true

we can see that this P is preserved in the following transitions
transition(2) gcd(2ex/2,2ey/2) =gcd(ex',ey')
transition(3)&(4) we know that at this point were past (2) so 2 is relatively prime to
either x or y so gcd(ex/2,ey) =gcd(ex',ey'), and similar for gcd(ex,ey/2)
on (7) x and y are equal so we have gcd(x,0) = gcd(x',y')
gcd(e*1,e*0) = e = gcd(a,b)



(b)
transitions(2)
will make at least one of {x,y} odd, possibly both

transformation (3) & transformation (4)
will make both odd.
transition(5) will then
have odd minus odd to make x even, y stays y(odd)
transofrmation(6)
x is odd and y is odd
x becomes even , y becomes the old odd x
the last transformation (7) is terminating
we never get sent back to even , even for {x,y}

(c)
if we look at the case of a large odd y
we would go through transition (6) then transition (3) then (5) in between halving of y
i would note that this would be a strange case
and it seem more likely that we bounce between a a (5) or(6) and a then a halving with (3) or (4)
we know their will be always a (7)
so 1+3(loga + logb) is some kind of upper bound


Problem 4.
(a)
we can use the fact that the gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b) = ab
c is a divisor of a,b and c is a divisor of d, for d = ab/lcm(a,b),
hense d is the gcd(a,b)
our proof is as follows
c is a divsor of a,b so by def a,b our divsors of ab/c which means
lcm(a,b) is a divisor of ab/c and c is a divisor of ab/lcm(a,b)

and ab/lcm(a,b) by original definition is the gcd(a,b)
QED

(b)
gcd(a,b) = 1 = ua + vb, for some u and v
multipied by c
we have c = uac + vbc
if a | bc then aq = bc so
c = uac + vaq = (uc + vq)a
QED

(c)
proof by contradiction lets assume p doesnt divide a, b
but p|ab
so gcd(p,{a,b}) = 1
by linear combinations
xp + ya = 1
up + vb = 1

(xp + ya)(up + vb) = 1
xpup + xpvb + yaup + yavb = 1
by grouping
p(sup + swb tau) + ab(tw) = 1
i.e. pM + abN = 1; gcd(p,ab) = 1
thus a contradiction
QED

(d)
ax + by = m, smallest element of N+
let q = a/s
implies
a mod m = a - qm
= a - q(ax + by)
= a(1-qx) + b(-qy)
0 <= a mod m < m, we have that a mod m = 0,
we have m | a and m | b
thus m is a common divisor of a and b and so gcd(a,b) >= m
we also have that
gcd(a,b) | m , since m is a linear combo of a and b
implying gcd(a,b) <=m
both parts let us conclude that gcd(a,b) = m
