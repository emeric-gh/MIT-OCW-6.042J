Problem 1.
Proof by induction
1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + ... 1/n^2 < 2- 1/n ; for all n>1
by computation n=2 is true
P(k) implies P(k+1) for all k >2
assume
1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + ... 1/k^2  < 2- 1/k
and we would like to show,
1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + ... 1/k^2 + 1/(k+1)^2 < 2- 1/(k+1)
using our assumption
2-1/k + 1/(k+1)^2 < 2- 1/(k+1)
which becomes
1/(k+1)^2 - 1/k < -1/(k+1) then
-k^2 - k -1 / (k(K+1)^2) < -k^2 -k / (k(K+1)^2)
which clearly shows that P(k+1) is True, completing the proof

Problem 2.
a)
we can show that the n= 0 case bill is just in the middle
in the n+1 case if we assume that n is possible
than we take our n blocks with bill in teh corner, we rotate 3 them inward by pi radians and
we retile the 3 bills we no longer need and keep the last bill. thus showing the n+1 case.
b)if we accept (a) then we can take our n+1 case, in our base case we have
if we can use and an n-1 case we can take a middle bill and rotate him to an outward corner bill
when we make our n+1 size square we can take our 4 outward corner bills and rotate them inward to make 4 central bills and
tile over 3 of them,

Problem 3.
Proof by induction
S(n) = n + 12 cent postage can be made using only 3 + 7 moni stamps
S(0) = 12, which can be 3+3+3+3
assume S(k) = k + 12 is true
Case 1
when we have at least two threes, we remove two 3s and add one 7
this nets us 1 and proves the k+1
Case 2
when we have one 3, then we must have at least two sevens because 12 is the min.
in this case we would remove two sevens and add five 3s, netting 1 and proves k+1
Case 3
we have no 3s, similar to case 2 we have atleast two sevens and do the same procedure as case 2

this completes all cases and thus the proof.

Problem 4
This proof is bogus because the base case doesnt help confirm the n+1 case
in the base case n=1 there is no P, so we cant assume there is one in the specified n+1 cases
