Problem 1.
(a)
Step 1
sample space
car location will be
{1,2,3,4}
players guess will branch off of each element of the above
{1,2,3,4}
door revealed will be the next layer
on the selected door it will be 1 of the 3 wrong
if the wrong door was first selected it will be 2 of the remaining wrong doors

{1,2,3,4}---> ->{1,2,3,4} (1) -->{3,4}
                          (2) -->{1,3,4}
    in this example we have shown one tree with two branches
    the prize is behind door 1 , in the top the correct was initially selected
    in the bottom the wrong was initially selected. the rest of the tree iterates the same way.

(a)
in the simple tree of the sticking strategy
we have 1 win branch ,
and 3 loss branches

(step2)
we are interested in when the winning branch is selected

step 3 and 4
there is a 1/4 that the correct door is selected off the Start
for this strategy nothing else matters afterwards
ans = 1/4

(b)
We can simplify our tree to
4 branches,
branch 1 the correct door is a loss in the flipping strat.
branch 2-4, wrong initial guesses are shown 1 wrong, and then switch to either 1 wrong or 1 correct

(step2 )
we are interested in branches 2-4 that switch to the correct leaf
(step3)
each leaf is (1/2)(1/4)
(step 4)
there are 3 branches of interest so
3(1/2)(1/4) = 3/8
ans = 3/8

Problem 2.

(a)
the system could fail at probability p if all parts fail together.
so
Pr{f1,...,fn} = p ; Pr{empty} = 1-p

our sample space would be
Pr{Fi} = 0+0+0 + Pr{f1,...,fn} = p

(b)
this would be the opposite case
each part would only fail alone
Pr{Fi} = p for each i
Pr{empty} = 1 - np

because Pr{Fi} = p
we have Pr{F} = np

(c)

F = Union i is 1 to n of Fi
its given that Pr{f1} =p
this is less than
Pr{U Fi} by monotonicity
which is less than
Sigma from i=1 to n of Pr{Fi} by boole's inequality
which is equal to np

Problem 3.

the branches of our samples space can be mapped as
each line is a branch

H (p) -> H (p) >> first two layers of tree regresses as the game starts over (p^2)

H (p) -> T (1-p) >> win p(1-p)

T (1-p) -> H (p) >> loss (1-p)p

T (1-p) -> T (1-p) >> first two layers of tree regresses as the game starts over (1-p)^2

the liekly hood of winning is
s = p(1-p) + s*p^2 + s*(1-p)^2

the solution to this kinda has to be 1/2 for all p
we know this because its a fair game by description

by symmetry the chance of losing is 1/2 which completes the sample space.

Problem 4.

this proof will be similar to what we showed in problem 2

if An is pairwise disjoint events then we can use the Sum Rule (Rule 16.5.3) from the text

then we would have
Pr[U An] = SigmaNotation of Pr[An]

if any of the events coincide by nature then we can show that LHS < RHS
for example if we showed like in problem 2 part (c) that all of A happens togeather
then we would have

Pr[U An] < SigmaNotation of Pr[An]

therefore
the union bound holds
