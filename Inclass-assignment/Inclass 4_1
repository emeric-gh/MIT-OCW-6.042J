Problem 1.
(a)
Step 1
sample space
car location will be
{1,2,3,4}
players guess will branch off of each element of the above
{1,2,3,4}
door revealed will be the next layer
on the selected door it will be 1 of the 3 wrong
if the wrong door was first selected it will be 2 of the remaining wrong doors

{1,2,3,4}---> ->{1,2,3,4} (1) -->{3,4}
                          (2) -->{1,3,4}
    in this example we have shown one tree with two branches
    the prize is behind door 1 , in the top the correct was initially selected
    in the bottom the wrong was initially selected. the rest of the tree iterates the same way.

(a)
in the simple tree of the sticking strategy
we have 1 win branch ,
and 3 loss branches

(step2)
we are interested in when the winning branch is selected

step 3 and 4
there is a 1/4 that the correct door is selected off the Start
for this strategy nothing else matters afterwards
ans = 1/4

(b)
We can simplify our tree to
4 branches,
branch 1 the correct door is a loss in the flipping strat.
branch 2-4, wrong initial guesses are shown 1 wrong, and then switch to either 1 wrong or 1 correct

(step2 )
we are interested in branches 2-4 that switch to the correct leaf
(step3)
each leaf is (1/2)(1/4)
(step 4)
there are 3 branches of interest so
3(1/2)(1/4) = 3/8
ans = 3/8
