Problem 1.

a)
edge probabilities top to bottom are:
4/12
8/12
7/12
5/12
11/12
1/2



b)
note that happy is 16/144, 35/144, 33/144
the sum of happiness as a fraction
84/144

c)
Pr[Yale | Happy] =

16/144 / 84/144 = 4/21

d)
Yale is independent of happy IFF
Pr [Yale|Happy] =? Pr [Yale]

from (c) we know this isnt true

4/21 =/= 4/12

e)
similar to d
...
incomplete

Problem 2.

(a)
see figure

we sortof already know that A,B,C are all independent and have probability
of 1/2
A will have directly 1/2
B will have 2/4 and c will have 4/8 of the probability space

the leafs of our tree our each probability 1/8
so we have
ABD
ACD
BCD
D
four branches, totalling 1/2 probability for D

(b)
if these events were mutually independent then
Pr{A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D} = Pr[A]*Pr[B]*Pr[C]*Pr[D]
the right hand side is 1/16 so we know that this isnt true

(c)
the two unique cases are
Pr{A ∩ B ∩ C} = Pr[A]*Pr[B]*Pr[C]
this is 1/8th
Pr{A ∩ B ∩ D} = Pr[A]*Pr[B]*Pr[D]
also 1/8th, and similar to the 2 other cases

Problem 3.

(a)
