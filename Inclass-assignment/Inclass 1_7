Problem 1.
b Rinv. a iff a R b.

R is        | iff R-1 is
----------------------
total       | a surjection
a function  | an injection
a surjection| total
an injection| a function
a bijection | a bijection


Problem2.
A is size n, B is size m,
Prove that |A x B| = mn by defining a simple bijection from A x B
to non negative integers from 0 to mn -1

{a0b0, a0b1,...     a0b-1,... an-1bm-1}
{0   ,    1,...      m-1,...  mn-1}

Problem 3.
Assume f: A -> B is total function and A is finite. create the strongest
correct Statement
a) |f(A)| <= |B|, less than or equal
b) If f is a surjection, then |A| >= |B|, greater or equal if f is a surj.
c) If f is a surjection, then |f(A)| = |B|, is equal if f is surjection
d) If f is an injection, then |f(A)| = |A|, is equal if f is injective
e) If f is a bijection, then |A| = |B|, is equal if f is bijection

Problem 4.
Let R: A->B be a binary relation. Use an arrow counting argument to prove the
following generalization of the Mapping Rule 1. from the textbook.
Lemma. If R is a function and X âŠ† A, then
|X| >= |R(X)|

since X is a subset of A, then the map R(X) is still a function, R(X) will have <= 1 arrow out of each element in X.
Thus |X| will be >= to the # of arrows
 |R(x)| will be less than or equal to the number of arrows
 therfore |X| >= # arrows >= |R(X)|, and |X| >= |R(X)|

Problem 5.
(a) Prove that if A surj B and B surj C then A surj C
if A surj B, then |A| > |B|, and if B surj C then |B|>|C|
then |A| > |B| > |C| then |A|> |B| and we can map form A to C

(b) explain why A surj B iff B inj A
if A surj B then, # arrows >= |B|,
this implies that |A| >= # arrows

if B inj A then, there are <= 1 arrow in to A so
A >= # arrows
this implies that # arrows >= |B|
one implies the other there fore
A surj B iff B inj A, and
|A| >= # arrows >= |B|


(c) conclude from (a) and (b) that if A inj B and B inj C then A inj C
if we take (a) and (b) to be true then the map that goes from A -> B -> C
could be inversed as injection C->B->A this would also be inj. A->C from (a)
we could rename this to be A inj C, like the Statement

(d) explain why A inj B iff there is a total injective function ([=1 out, <= 1in])
from A to B
by definition A inj B, iff |A|<= |B|
so we would like to show that there is a total inj function f: A ->B
if we make our f map from every A 1 arrow, then it will be a total injuctive function because |A|<=|B|
if the A inj B was false and we had some different relationship between |A| and |B| and we tried to map from A -> B
with 1 arrow from A, then relation ship with B would also not hold.
