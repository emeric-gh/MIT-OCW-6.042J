Problem 1.
b Rinv. a iff a R b.

R is        | iff R-1 is
----------------------
total       | a surjection
a function  | an injection
a surjection| total
an injection| a function
a bijection | a bijection


Problem2.
A is size n, B is size m,
Prove that |A x B| = mn by defining a simple bijection from A x B
to non negative integers from 0 to mn -1


Problem 3.
Assume f: A -> B is total function and A is finite. create the strongest
correct Statemenst
a) |f(A)| |B|
b) If f is a surjection, then |A| |B|
c) If f is a surjection, then |f(A)| |B|
d) If f is an injection, then |f(A)| |A|
e) If f is a bijeciton, then |A| |B|

Problem 4.
Let R: A->B be a binary relation. Use an arrow counting argument to prove the
following generatlization of the Mapping Rule 1. from the textbook.
Lemma. If R is a function and X âŠ† A, then
|X| >= |R(X)|



Problem 5.
(a) Prove that if A surj B and B surj C then A surj C

(b) explain why A surj B iff B inj A

(c) conclude from (a) and (b) that if A inj B and B inj C then A inj C

(d) explain why A inj B iff there is a total injective function ([=1 out, <= 1in])
from A to B
