inclass 3.5

Problem 1.

(a)
ids are pigeons, sums are holes
8 places 9 different digits
8*9 = 72 different sums
there are more birds than holes

(b)
we can describe each number as k*37 + a
a is on the interval 0-36
this could also be stated as k1 congruent k2 (rem 37)
so there are 37 holes and 100 pigeons
implies atleast two birds one hole

(c)
if we divide the unit square into 4 equal square quarters we can place each point in corner of the squares
then we see that the 5th point will be atleast 1/rad(2) away from one of the existing points because that is the
corner to corner distance of our subsquare.
in this way we have 5 birds and 4 holes

(d)
the holes can be in each odd number.
there are n odd number holes, and n+1 birds

Problem 2.
(a)
the word "drop" will be in one of seven positions around the remaining 6 letters
then rest of the letters can be arranged in some string
7*6!

(b)
words that contain drop and fails
these words are 1 part "drop", 1 part "fails", 1 part "e"
so the answer is 3!
or 6

(c)
10! / ((7*6! * 6*5! * 5*4!) * 3! * 2!)


Problem 3.

(a)
number of paths
100! / (50!)^2

100 choose 50 - (21 choose 10 * 79 choose 40) - 41 choose 21 * 59 choose 29
+ 21 choose 10 * 20 choose 11 * 59 choose 29
