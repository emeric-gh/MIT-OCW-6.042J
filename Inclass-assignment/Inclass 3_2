Problem 1.
(a)
g(n) = 3n
f(n) = n^2

f != O(g)

g = O(f)
c=3

(b)

f(n) = (3n-7)/(n+4)
g(n) = 4

f=O(g)
c=1
n0 = 0
g=O(f)


(c)
f = O(g)
g = O(f)

c=1
n0=1


 Problem 2.

(a)
asymptotically equal is an Equivalence relation

the little Oh relation is strict partial order

big Oh relation is a weak partial order

Theta realtion is an equivalence realtion

f = O(g) and NOT g = O(f) is a strict partial order

(b)

f = o(g) implies f = O(g)
f ~ g implies f = Theta(g)
f ~ g implies f = O(g)


Problem 3.

there is a problem with the induction step
the should not have multiplied through by 2. the LHS is correct but the
RHS should still be c*1
