Problem 1.

(a)
Digraph by ordered pairs
(v,a)(a,b)(b,v)(v,x)(x,y)(y,v)

note that our even closed path is
vabvxyv

note that our only cycles odd length, of 3
EG abva, or vxyv

(b)
Digraph by ordered pairs
(v,a)(a,b)(b,x)(x,y)(y,b)(b,a)(a,b)

note that we have a even non-cycle closed path, connected to a odd length cycle that doesnt contain v
giving us our odd length path with no cycle containing v

to



Problem 2.
dist(u,v) <= dist(u,x) + dist(x,v) iff x is on a shortest path from u to v

(a) ****incomplete****
proof of iff from left to right

(b) ****incomplete****
proof of iff from right to left


Problem 3.

(a) 0111010001
***incomplete***
explain why this is the shortest length 3-good

(b) each vertex of the figure 1 is every 2 bit combination the add the edge value to each vertex and we get every possible
combination of 3 bits. since the edge tranforms a 2 bit vertex to the next 2 bit vertex we know they can describe one string of bits
therefor if we travel along all edges we know that our string will be 3-good.
my string path is (01) +1 (11) +1 (11) +0 (10) +1 (01) +0 (00) +0 (00) +1 (01)

(c)
from part (b) we know including every edge gives a 3-good
so including every edge once and no more gives us the minimum string length that is a 3-good

(d)***incomplete***
the minimum length is 2 * 2^k + k

-transitions of Bk
-in transitions and out transitions
positive path from any vertex to any other vertex of lenght at most k
